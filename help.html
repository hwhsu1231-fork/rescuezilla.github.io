<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Is Rescuezilla a drop-in replacement to Clonezilla?</h3>
<p>A: No, not yet. However, with your contributions on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/rescuezilla">Patreon</a> it will be that, and much more!</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Does Rescuezilla support booting on EFI-only machines?</h3>
<p>A: Rescuezilla can backup and restore EFI partitions without issue. However Rescuezilla cannot boot on machines with firmware that only supports EFI and does not support legacy-boot (eg, Macs) unless worked around by first booting <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.11.4">rEFInd from a separate USB drive</a>. EFI support is coming in v1.0.6 (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/1">#1</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Rescuezilla hangs during boot!</h3>
<p>A: Some computers boot extremely slow. Give it a minute, especially if the computer continues to read from the USB drive. If you only experience this when booting from USB, it is possible that in the BIOS, your USB&nbsp;drive may need to be identified as USB-HDD, USB-ZIP, or some other setting that may improve performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q:&nbsp;My backup froze at XX% and no error was given! What happened?</h3>
<p>A: Close the backup program. Open the redobackup.logs directory on desktop and view the most recent log file to see what went wrong. Then file a bug report and upload the log file. Remember that Rescuezilla is a frontend to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://partclone.org">Partclone</a> project, so if you can run partclone successfully, Rescuezilla should work for you.&nbsp;Also remember that if the drive is filled or otherwise becomes inaccessible (e.g. loss of network connection)&nbsp;while a backup is being saved or restored, the process will fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q:&nbsp;Can I&nbsp;restore a backup to a smaller drive?</h3>
<p>A: No. Rescuezilla currently does not support this. Backups must be restored to a drive of equal or greater size.</p>
<p>However, you can always restore to a larger drive, resize the partition, and back up the smaller partition if needed. Partitions can easily be resized using the included partition editor utility&nbsp;(GParted). A future version will support this.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q:&nbsp;I restored my Linux backup using Rescuezilla. It boots past the GRUB bootloader fully, but the Linux boot gets stuck at "Rescue Mode" login prompt. How do I fix this?</h3>
<p>A: For modern systemd Linux environments (such as Ubuntu 18.04), the partitions listed in the /etc/fstab file <i>must</i> be present for the system to complete booting. This means if the hard drive environment does not match exactly, the system will enter Rescue Mode until the /etc/fstab is modified to only refer to the drives which are present in the system.</p>
<p>Fixing a machine in this situation requires logging in at the Rescue Mode prompt, remounting the root partition as read/write, modifying /etc/fstab to remove the line of the partition which is no longer present, then remounting the root partition as read-only before hard rebooting the machine. There are plenty of guides on the internet to help fix this particular issue. If you need further help, post on the discussion forum and you will receive detailed assistance for as long as it takes to fix your issues.</p>
<p>Please note, in some older Linux distributions it's not the partition's UUID that is used by /etc/fstab but the partition's device node (eg. /dev/sdc1). This means the Linux boot is expecting a hard drive connnected to an identical numbered SATA port! But dont worry, any problems can be resolved by modifying /etc/fstab. As mentioned, if you need more help please ask for it on the forum.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Can I use the same Rescuezilla USB drive with many computers simultaneously?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. Select the 'Safe Mode' menu item (which includes the 'toram' parameter) and wait for the system to boot before removing the USB drive. Because this loads all of Rescuezilla into memory, please note the minimum RAM requirements are higher.</p>
