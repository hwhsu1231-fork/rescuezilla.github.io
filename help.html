<p>Please take a moment to read our FAQ below, as it has the answers to the most common questions we receive about Rescuezilla. If you don't find the answer here, please check <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/wiki/Rescuezilla-Limitations">Rescuezilla limitations</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues">GitHub issues</a> before posting your questions or suggestions to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/redobackup/forums">Rescuezilla forum currently hosted on SourceForge</a>.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Is Rescuezilla a drop-in replacement to Clonezilla?</h3>
<p>A: No, not yet. However, with your contributions on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/rescuezilla">Patreon</a> it can be that, and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement">much more</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Does Rescuezilla support EFI boot?</h3>
<p>A: Rescuezilla v1.0.5 only supports legacy BIOS boot. EFI support is coming in v1.0.6 (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/1">#1</a>). A quick workaround for systems that do not support legacy MBR is to first boot <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.11.4">rEFInd from a flashdrive</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Rescuezilla hangs during boot!</h3>
<p>A: Some computers boot extremely slow. Give it a minute, especially if the computer continues to read from the USB drive. If you only experience this when booting from USB, it is possible that in the BIOS, your USB&nbsp;drive may need to be identified as USB-HDD, USB-ZIP, or some other setting that may improve performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q:&nbsp;My backup froze at XX% and no error was given! What happened?</h3>
<p>A: Close the backup program. Open the redobackup.logs directory on desktop and view the most recent log file to see what went wrong. Then file a bug report and upload the log file. Remember that Rescuezilla is a frontend to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://partclone.org">Partclone</a> project, so if you can run partclone successfully, Rescuezilla should work for you.&nbsp;Also remember that if the drive is filled or otherwise becomes inaccessible (e.g. loss of network connection)&nbsp;while a backup is being saved or restored, the process will fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q:&nbsp;Can I&nbsp;restore a backup to a smaller drive?</h3>
<p>A: No. Doing so likely would require modifying the bootloader, which defeats the simplicity of Rescuezilla. Backups must be restored to a drive of equal or greater size.</p>
<p>However, you can always restore to a larger drive, resize the partition, and back up the smaller partition if needed. Partitions can easily be resized using the included partition editor utility&nbsp;(GParted).</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Can I use the same Rescuezilla USB drive with many computers simultaneously?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. Select the 'Safe Mode' menu item (which includes the 'toram' parameter) and wait for the system to boot before removing the USB drive.</p>
</div>
<h2>Report a Bug</h2>
<p>If you are fairly certain that you've encountered a bug, please review this checklist:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is the problem the result of the Rescuezilla program, or is it a hardware incompatibility issue that should be reported to Ubuntu Linux?</li>
    <li>If you give us the steps, can we reproduce the error on our end?</li>
    <li>Is the behavior an actual error, or is it merely different from how you would prefer the software work?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are confident that you've found an error we need to know about, we encourage you to take a moment and provide us with the information we need to fix it. Your participation ensures a better project that we all benefit from.</p>
<p>To view the Rescuezilla <strong>log file</strong> to see the specific error message that caused your problem, read the FAQ&nbsp;above.&nbsp;Remember that Rescuezilla is simply a front end, and that <a href="http://partclone.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Partclone</a> is the actual program doing the work. If your error lies with Partclone, please contact Partclone to file a bug with their team, rather than sending it to us.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit a </strong><a href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues" rel="nofollow"><strong>Bug Report</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>If you have questions, suggestions, or requests (rather than an actual bug report) please go to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/redobackup/forums">Rescuezilla forum currently hosted on SourceForge</a>, where you can participate in existing discussions or open a new topic.</p>
