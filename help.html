<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Is Rescuezilla a drop-in replacement to Clonezilla?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Since v2.0, Rescuezilla can restore backups created by Clonezilla, and backups created by Rescuezilla can be restored using Clonezilla.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Is Rescuezilla related to Redo Rescue?</h3>
  <p>A: Kind of. Both are independent projects originally built upon the same base, but have different goals and methadologies so are developed separately.</p>
  <p>Launched in November 2019, Rescuezilla is an fork of an old application named <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em> after it had been abandoned by its original author since 2012 (leaving hundreds of open forum threads including many users struggling to restore important data without any support being provided).</p>
  <p>In June 2020, the original <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em> author suddenly resurfaced after a 7.5 year absence and released a new version named &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/redobackup/discussion/general/thread/d0e37c4750/">Redo Rescue</a>&rdquo; and deleted all of the user-support that Rescuezilla was systematically providing to the hundreds of open forum threads.</p>
  <p>Rescuezilla is fully interoperable with Clonezilla and has a much broader goals, including eventually adding support for Redo Rescue image format.</p>

  <h3>Q: Rescuezilla backup and restore is running VERY slow for me. How do I fix this?</h3>
  <p>A: On machines with 16GB of RAM or greater, backup/restore speeds become intolerably slow when using the 32-bit version of Resecuezilla. On machines 64-bit machines with 16GB of RAM or greater, always use the 64-bit version of Rescuezilla.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: I restored my Linux backup using Rescuezilla. It boots past the GRUB bootloader fully, but the Linux boot gets stuck at "Rescue Mode" login prompt. How do I fix this?</h3>
<p>A: For modern systemd Linux environments (such as Ubuntu 18.04), the partitions listed in the /etc/fstab file <i>must</i> be present for the system to complete booting. This means if the hard drive environment does not match exactly, the system will enter Rescue Mode until the /etc/fstab is modified to only refer to the drives which are present in the system.</p>
<p>Fixing a machine in this situation requires logging in at the Rescue Mode prompt, remounting the root partition as read/write, modifying /etc/fstab to remove the line of the partition which is no longer present, then remounting the root partition as read-only before hard rebooting the machine. There are plenty of guides on the internet to help fix this particular issue. If you need further help, post on the <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/rescuezilla/discussion/">support forum</a> and you will receive detailed assistance for as long as it takes to fix your issues.</p>
<p>Please note, in some older Linux distributions it's not the partition's UUID that is used by /etc/fstab but the partition's device node (eg. /dev/sdc1). This means the Linux boot is expecting a hard drive connnected to an identical numbered SATA port! But don't worry, any problems can be resolved by modifying /etc/fstab. As mentioned, if you need more help please ask for it on the <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/rescuezilla/discussion/">support forum</a>.</p>

<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: I am having trouble connecting to a network shared directory using SMB/CIFS?</h3>
  <p>A: First make sure the fields have the correct UNC path (eg "\\fileserver\johnsmith") and username/password. Some network shares may not support the default SMB 3.1.1 protocol, so you may need to enter '2.1' or even '1.0' in the version field.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: How do I install new software packages?</h3>
  <p>A: It is possible for advanced users to use the command-line to install software from Ubuntu (remember to first run 'apt-get update'). However any newly installed software lives only in your computer's main memory so will disappear when you reboot your computer (see next question). Also on machines without much RAM, please always double-check you have enough free space before installing anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Can I modify Rescuezilla to save my settings between reboots?</h3>
  <p>A: No, not easily. The Rescuezilla USB stick operates in a read-only mode and loads a &ldquo;nonpersistent&rdquo; environment into your computer's memory. This environment disappear after you reboot your computer, along with any modifications you have made. Some users have requested Rescuezilla switch to a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; environment. This feature request is tracked by task <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/8">#8</a>. Please support Rescuezilla by contributing $1/month on the crowdfunding website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/rescuezilla">Patreon</a> to support the implementation of this feature (and many others).</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Can I use the same Rescuezilla USB drive with many computers simultaneously?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. Select the 'Load USB into RAM' menu item and wait for the system to boot before removing the USB drive. Because this loads all of Rescuezilla into memory, please note the minimum RAM requirements are higher.</p>
