<p>Please take a moment to read the FAQ below, as it has the answers to the most common questions about Rescuezilla. If you don't find the answer here, please search the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/wiki/Rescuezilla-Limitations">Rescuezilla limitations</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
<p>Rescuezilla an actively developed version of an old application named <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em>. Rescuezilla provides world-class support to as many users as possible. Historically the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/redobackup/forums">Sourceforge forum of the formerly abandoned <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em> project</a> was used to provide official Rescuezilla support. Rescuezilla will soon be switching to a new support forum.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: I want to surgically move a partition from one machine to another. Is Rescuezilla suitable for me?</h3>
  <p>A: No, absolutely not. As stated in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/wiki/Rescuezilla-Limitations">Rescuezilla limitations page</a>, <strong>Rescuezilla currently only officially supports backing up and restoring entire disks. Individual partition backup and restore is very immature right now and is not recommended.</strong> The tracking number for this task is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/46">#46</a> and it will be completed for Rescuezilla v1.0.7 (to be released in a few months).</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Is Rescuezilla a drop-in replacement to Clonezilla?</h3>
<p>A: No, not yet. However, Rescuezilla v1.0.7 will support the image format used by Clonezilla. This will mean backups created by Clonezilla will be able to be restored with Rescuezilla (and vice versa). The tracking number for this task is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/4">#4</a>. Please support Rescuezilla by contributing $1/month on the crowdfunding website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/rescuezilla">Patreon</a> to support the implementation of this feature (and many others).</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Does Rescuezilla support EFI?</h3>
  <p>A: Yes, since v1.0.6 the 64-bit version of Rescuezilla can boot on any EFI-only machine (including with Secure Boot enabled), and both Rescuezilla 32-bit and 64-bit can boot on legacy PC-BIOS machines. Rescuezilla can safely backup and restore all fileystems on GPT formatted disks often used with EFI systems, as well all filesystems on traditional DOS (MBR) formatted disks.</p>
  </div> 
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Is Rescuezilla related to Redo Rescue?</h3>
  <p>A: Kind of. Both are independent projects but originally built upon the same base. Rescuezilla is a methodical revival an old application named <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em> which was abandoned by its original author between 2012 and 2020 (leaving hundreds of open forum threads including many users struggling to restore important data without any support being provided). Since the initial release in November 2019, the Rescuezilla developer has systematically unified a number of unofficial customized <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em> versions (including language translations) into a single version that, after many attempts to contact the original author with the changes, was reluctantly released under the new name &ldquo;Rescuezilla&rdquo;. The Rescuezilla developer continues to release new versions to provide backwards compatibility, bug fixes, new features and user support for everybody to benefit from, including a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/projects/3">major upgrade</a> planned for v1.0.7.</p>
  <p>In June 2020, the original <em>Redo Backup and Recovery</em> author suddenly resurfaced after a 7.5 year absence and released a new version named &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/redobackup/discussion/1169663/thread/d0e37c4750/">Redo Rescue</a>&rdquo; with some features that were planned for Rescuezilla v1.0.7. Despite this, Rescuezilla will continue to be actively developed, and from v1.0.7, Rescuezilla will always maintain complete feature parity and restore compatibility with Redo Rescue, in addition to the already planned Clonezilla image format support and other Rescuezilla-specific enhancements and improvements.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Can I restore a backup to a smaller drive?</h3>
<p>A: No, Rescuezilla currently does not support this. Backups must be restored to a drive of equal or greater size.</p>
<p>However, you can always restore to a larger drive, resize the partition, and back up the smaller partition if needed. Partitions can easily be resized using the included partition editor utility&nbsp;(GParted). A future version will support this.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Rescuezilla v1.0.6 64-bit takes a long time to shutdown. How do I fix this?</h3>
  <p>A: Sorry for any inconvenience, this is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/87">being investigated</a>. The 32-bit version continues to have near-instantaneous shutdown speed, so if you have less than 16GB RAM you may prefer to use that version for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Rescuezilla backup and restore is running VERY slow for me. How do I fix this?</h3>
  <p>A: On machines with 16GB of RAM or greater, backup/restore speeds become intolerably slow when using the 32-bit version of Resecuezilla. On machines 64-bit machines with 16GB of RAM or greater, always use the 64-bit version of Rescuezilla.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Does Rescuezilla support Mac?</h3>
  <p>A: Yes, since v1.0.6 the 64-bit version of Rescuezilla can boot on all Intel-based Mac's, and Rescuezilla is always able to backup and restore all hard disks without issue. Rescuezilla does not yet support &ldquo;filesystem-aware&rdquo; backup of the APFS filesystem (which is used since macOS High Sierra). This means for APFS filesystems Rescuezilla copies both free space <em>and</em> used space, resulting in a larger backup image. A future version of Rescuezilla will add filesystem-aware APFS support. The tracking number for this task is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/65">#65</a>.</p>

<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: I restored my Linux backup using Rescuezilla. It boots past the GRUB bootloader fully, but the Linux boot gets stuck at "Rescue Mode" login prompt. How do I fix this?</h3>
<p>A: For modern systemd Linux environments (such as Ubuntu 18.04), the partitions listed in the /etc/fstab file <i>must</i> be present for the system to complete booting. This means if the hard drive environment does not match exactly, the system will enter Rescue Mode until the /etc/fstab is modified to only refer to the drives which are present in the system.</p>
<p>Fixing a machine in this situation requires logging in at the Rescue Mode prompt, remounting the root partition as read/write, modifying /etc/fstab to remove the line of the partition which is no longer present, then remounting the root partition as read-only before hard rebooting the machine. There are plenty of guides on the internet to help fix this particular issue. If you need further help, post on the discussion forum and you will receive detailed assistance for as long as it takes to fix your issues.</p>
<p>Please note, in some older Linux distributions it's not the partition's UUID that is used by /etc/fstab but the partition's device node (eg. /dev/sdc1). This means the Linux boot is expecting a hard drive connnected to an identical numbered SATA port! But don't worry, any problems can be resolved by modifying /etc/fstab. As mentioned, if you need more help please ask for it on the forum.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: My Linux backup created with Rescuezilla v1.0.5.1 (or earlier) does not boot. How do I fix this?</h3>
  <p>A: A small number of backups of Linux environments that were created with Rescuezilla v1.0.5.1 or earlier are unable to have the GRUB bootloader restored correctly, leaving the user unable to boot into their systems. The root cause is Rescuezilla v1.0.5.1 not fully backing up certain larger-than-typical GRUB bootloaders which sometimes reside on traditional DOS (MBR) formatted disks. This issue reportedly affected a small number of Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MXLinux and Peppermint Linux environments. A deeper technical explanation is available in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/64">#64</a>.</p>   <p>But don't worry, all your data is completely safe. If you're one of the unlucky few users experiencing this issue, a GRUB repair needs to be manually conducted for your system to properly boot. First, try restoring with the latest version of Rescuezilla. Then use Rescuezilla to follow <a target="_blank" href="http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/11/reinstall-grub-ubuntu-wont-boot/">this guide</a>. If you need more detailed support, post on the forum to receive direct support for as long as it takes to restore your system to full operation.</p>
  <p>Since Rescuezilla v1.0.6, these larger-than-typical GRUB bootloaders are correctly backed up, so everything should restore correctly. If you discover any situation where something is not restoring correctly, please immediately report a bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: I am having trouble connecting to a network shared directory using SMB/CIFS?</h3>
  <p>A: First make sure the fields have the correct UNC path (eg "\\fileserver\johnsmith") and username/password. Some network shares may not support the default SMB 3.1.1 protocol, so you may need to enter '2.1' or even '1.0' in the version field. There's also an issue with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/4">samba servers hosted on Ubuntu 20.04</a> that is currently being investigated.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: How do I install new software packages?</h3>
  <p>A: It is possible for advanced users to use the command-line to install software from Ubuntu (remember to first run 'apt-get update'). However any newly installed software lives only in your computer's main memory so will disappear when you reboot your computer (see next question). Also on machines without much RAM, please always double-check you have enough free space before installing anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Can I modify Rescuezilla to save my settings between reboots?</h3>
  <p>A: No, not easily. The Rescuezilla USB stick operates in a read-only mode and loads a &ldquo;nonpersistent&rdquo; environment into your computer's memory. This environment disappear after you reboot your computer, along with any modifications you have made. Some users have requested Rescuezilla switch to a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; environment. This feature request is tracked by task <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/8">#8</a>. Please support Rescuezilla by contributing $1/month on the crowdfunding website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/rescuezilla">Patreon</a> to support the implementation of this feature (and many others).</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
  <h3>Q: Is Rescuezilla related to Clonezilla?</h3>
  <p>A: Rescuezilla has no relation to Clonezilla, which is a separate project by a different developer. However, Rescuezilla v1.0.7 will be optionally be able to backup and restore hard drives in same image format used by Clonezilla.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq rounded">
<h3>Q: Can I use the same Rescuezilla USB drive with many computers simultaneously?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. Select the 'Safe Mode' menu item (which includes the 'toram' parameter) and wait for the system to boot before removing the USB drive. Because this loads all of Rescuezilla into memory, please note the minimum RAM requirements are higher.</p>
