<h1>Easy Backup and Recovery</h1>
<p><strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> is so simple that anyone can use it. It is the easiest, most complete disaster recovery solution available. It allows <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_metal_restore" target="_blank">bare-metal restore</a>, which means that even if your hard drive melts or gets completely erased by a virus, you can have a completely-functional system back up and running in as little as 10 minutes.</p>
<p>All your documents and settings will be restored to the exact same state they were in when the last snapshot was taken. <strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> works with Windows and Linux systems, so you can use the same tool for every machine. And because it is open source released under the GPL, it is <strong>completely free</strong> for personal and commercial use.</p>

<h2>More Features, Less Complex</h2>
<p>Redo Backup has the most features coupled with the simplest, most user-friendly interface:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Easy <strong>graphical user interface</strong> boots in less than a minute</li>
    <li><strong>No installation needed</strong>; runs from a CD-ROM or a USB stick</li>
    <li>Saves and restores <strong>Windows and Linux</strong> machines</li>
    <li>Automatically finds <strong>local network shares</strong></li>
    <li>Access your files <strong>even if you can't log in</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Recover deleted pictures,</strong> documents, and other files</li>
    <li><strong>Internet access with Firefox</strong> to download drivers</li>
    <li>Download size is <strong>less than 75MB</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Not Use...?</h2>
<p>Many excellent solutions such as Clonezilla and Norton Ghost already exist. However, most backup tools cost money, only save data files (rather than the whole system), or come with restrictive licenses. While there are some open source alternatives, these programs are often far too complex for regular users, and most require knowledge of a command line, or ask too many difficult questions.</p>
<p>Everyday computer users, more than any other group, need an intuitive point-and-click solution that can recover them from a disaster, and <strong>Redo&nbsp;Backup and Recovery</strong> was designed for this very purpose. It is the simplest open source backup and recovery solution available.</p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p><strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> is just a GPLv3 Perl script built with a GTK2+ interface designed in Glade. It is simply a front end to <a href="http://partclone.org/" rel="nofollow">partclone</a>, which performs the actual backup and restore. The live CD is built with <a href="http://xpud.org/" rel="nofollow">xPUD</a> to provide a graphical user interface and unmodified binaries of each program, but the script will run on any Linux platform that has the required programs installed. The Perl source code for the &quot;redobackup&quot; script is contained in the live CD&nbsp;itself. The source code for all other components is available from their respective project homes, subject to their respective licenses.</p>
