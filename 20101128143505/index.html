<h1>Easy Backup, Recovery &amp; Bare Metal Restore</h1>
<p><strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> is so simple that anyone can use it. It is the easiest, most complete disaster recovery solution available. It allows <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_metal_restore" target="_blank">bare-metal restore</a>. <strong>Bare metal restore</strong> means that even if your hard drive melts or gets completely erased by a virus, you can have a completely-functional system back up and running in as little as 10 minutes.</p>
<p>All your documents and settings will be restored to the exact same state they were in when the last snapshot was taken. <strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> is a live CD, so it does not matter if you use Windows or Linux. You can use the same tool to backup and restore every machine. And because it is open source released under the GPL, it is <strong>completely free</strong> for personal and commercial use.</p>

<h2>More Features, Less Complex</h2>
<p>Redo Backup has the most features coupled with the simplest, most user-friendly interface:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Easy <strong>graphical user interface</strong> boots from CD&nbsp;in less than a minute</li>
    <li><strong>No installation needed</strong>; runs from a CD-ROM or a USB stick</li>
    <li>Saves and restores <strong>Windows and Linux</strong> machines</li>
    <li>Automatically finds <strong>local network shares</strong></li>
    <li>Access your files <strong>even if you can't log in</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Recover deleted pictures,</strong> documents, and other files</li>
    <li><strong>Internet access with Firefox</strong> to download drivers</li>
    <li>Live CD&nbsp;download size is <strong>only about 75MB</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Not Use...?</h2>
<p>Many excellent solutions such as Acronis and Norton Ghost already exist. However, most backup tools cost money, only save data files (rather than the whole system), or come with restrictive licenses. Many are applications that are designed to run on a specific platform. While there are some open source alternatives, these programs are often far too complex for regular users, and most require knowledge of a command line, or ask too many difficult questions.</p>
<p>Everyday computer users, more than any other group, need an intuitive point-and-click solution that can recover them from a disaster, and <strong>Redo&nbsp;Backup and Recovery</strong> was designed for this very purpose. It is the simplest open source backup and recovery solution available.</p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Most backup and restore programs require your system to be up and running in order to restore. But what if you cannot boot into Windows? What if you have a nasty virus, and you can't even open Windows to try to restore it back to how it was?</p>
<p>Redo doesn't need Windows. Download and burn the ISO, place it in your CD-ROM&nbsp;drive, and reboot your machine. The system will load a complete mini operating system with a point-and-click user interface into your computer's memory, without writing any information to your hard drive. Then you will be able to perform backup, restore and recovery actions&mdash;guaranteed&mdash;even if you aren't able to boot into your regular operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> is a GPLv3 Perl script built with a GTK2+ interface designed in Glade. It is simply a front end to <a href="http://partclone.org/" rel="nofollow">partclone</a>, which performs the actual backup and restore. The live CD is built with <a href="http://xpud.org/" rel="nofollow">xPUD</a> to provide a graphical user interface and unmodified binaries of each program, but the script will run on any Linux platform that has the required programs installed. The Perl source code for the&nbsp;script is contained on the live CD&nbsp;itself. The source code for all other components is available from their respective project homes, subject to their respective licenses.</p>
